                <p>Child tribute is a way of recognizing and honoring the innocence, joy, and unique perspectives that are often associated with childhood. Children bring an unparalleled vibrancy to our lives; they challenge us to look at things from new angles and expand our horizons in so many ways. When we truly notice them and celebrate their achievements, it helps unlock potential for a brighter future both now and years down the road.</p>
